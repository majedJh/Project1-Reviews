## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This is the first project I make without repeating after any online course guide, so it helped me recall a lot of things I forgot eariler while self-learning. 

### Continued development

I'd like to implement more flex/grid usage, semantic HTML5, and custom web elements.
